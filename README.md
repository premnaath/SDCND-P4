# SDCND-P4
This repo was created to hold all files related to project 4 of SDCND by Udacity.

**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Contents of the repo
* doc_images - Folder that holds generated output images used for documenting
* camera_calibration.py - Python file that is used for camera calibration.
* camera_coefficients.p _ Python pickle file that has the calculated camera coefficients
* find_lanes.py - Python file that detects the lane lines in a video
* writeup_report.md - Report for the project
